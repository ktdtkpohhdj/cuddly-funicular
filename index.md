## Contribution guidlines

We encourage contributions to the enchanted-surrogates package! Here are some guidelines to help you get started. If you are interested in adding a new code plugin, please refer to the [Plugins](./plugins/index.md) section for more details.

- `main` branch is for stable code (releases)
- `develop` branch is for latest development code (merges from feature branches)
- `develop/{feature}` or `develop/{user}` for changes.
- `bug/{descriptive_name}` for bug fixes.
- **One feature or fix per pull request**. This ensures that changes are isolated and easier to review. Be respectful of your fellow developers and create small, focused pull requests.
- Use pull requests to merge branches. Delete branch after merge.
- Use `Issues` for bug reports, feature requests, etc.
- For longer term items to be integrated, e.g., Active Learning, suggest to use `Issues` followed by a branch. 
- The configs folder in the source is to be kept for example config files and example cases that would be benefical to the wider community. Plugin-specific config files should be kept in the plugin repository.

### Coding Style Standards

The coding standard [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) should be used. 
Although we will likely lint with `flake` so don't worry too much about it.
